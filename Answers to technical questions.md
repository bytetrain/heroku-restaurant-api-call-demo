A demo, for heroku restaurant api call and parsing json, application using React.

# Get Started

1. **How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.**

    First time running the starter kit? Then complete the [Initial Machine Setup](#initial-machine-setup).

2. **What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.**

    `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot.git`.

3. **How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?**

    `npm run setup`

4. **How would you improve the API that you just used?**

    `npm start -s`

    This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.

5. **Please describe yourself using JSON.**

    This starter kit includes a working example app that calculates fuel savings. Note how all source code is placed under /src. Tests are placed alongside the file under test. The final built app is placed under /dist. These are the files you run in production.
